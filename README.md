# Before you start.
These are test builds. There will be bugs. I'm not aware of any bugs that lose data, however, the program might hang, lag in the UI or bug in certain operations (such as updating the status of a compression from "paused" to "compressing" in the UI, despite it compressing in the background). You can see all known bugs in the [release](https://github.com/oracularhades/hades-compression/releases) information.

This is a UI for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), so that the average person can take advantage of it's awesome features, without opening a terminal. This program includes non-native FFmpeg features, like the ability to pause/resume encodings and easily run encodings automatically. I did not build the file compression here, though I'm sure every developer wishes they could take credit for it. All video encoding is done via [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

For potential contributors: I've barely done any code clean-up, I will go back and optimise/comment the code, but bare with me. These are still test builds.
